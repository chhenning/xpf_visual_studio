# A Visual Studio solution using xpf 3.04
My goal is to be able to compile and run pdftohtml tool.

1. There is no source code included in this solution. Download latest code from http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html

2. Replace source and include file/folders in the solution.

3. I suggest you use vcpkg to compile 3rd party libs, like zlib, libpng, etc.
